# Weekly Planner & To‑Do List

A single HTML/CSS/JS page you can double-click from any folder and start planning. No build tools, no frameworks—just a drag-and-drop weekly board that saves to `localStorage`.

## How to use

1. Download or clone this folder.
2. Open `index.html` directly in your browser (Chrome, Edge, Firefox, Safari all work).
3. Add tasks in the left column and drag them onto any day/category.
4. Export your data regularly if you want a backup or to move to another computer.

## Features

- **Task pool** grouped by urgency/importance.
- **Weekly board** with Goals, Must Do, Priority Tasks, Chores, Events, and Habits for every day.
- **Drag & drop** between the pool, the board, and the trash.
- **Local storage** persistence plus JSON export/import and a reset button.
- **Desktop-friendly** layout; install it as a Progressive Web App (Edge/Chrome → ⋮ menu → “Install app”).

No `npm install` is required unless you want to host it behind a static server. If you do, any simple HTTP server (`python -m http.server`, `npx serve`, etc.) will work.
